# SAP ABAP Student Table

This project demonstrates a **Managed RAP (RESTful ABAP Programming Model) Scenario** developed in **SAP ABAP Cloud** for maintaining student data.

The application enables users to create, manage, and maintain student records using a **Fiori Elements application** generated through CDS Views, Behavior Definitions, and Service Bindings.
